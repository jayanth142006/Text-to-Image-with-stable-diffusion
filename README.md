# Stable Diffusion Prompt-to-Image GUI
This project is a simple GUI application built with CustomTkinter that leverages Stable Diffusion via Hugging Face's diffusers library to generate AI images from text prompts.

Supports both GPU (fp16) and CPU (float32) execution.

Uses the CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 model for image generation.

Prompts can be entered through the GUI, and the generated image is saved locally as output.png.
